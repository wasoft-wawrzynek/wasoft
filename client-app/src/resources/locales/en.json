The project serves as both a digital resume and a demonstration of modern web development practices, featuring a responsive design that adapts seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes.<br><br>The front-end is built with React 18 and TypeScript, leveraging Vite for lightning-fast development experience and optimized production builds. It incorporates TailwindCSS for modern styling, custom animations for enhanced user experience, and i18next for complete multilingual support across three languages (English, Polish, and Silesian dialect). The application features smooth scrolling navigation, interactive floating cards with parallax effects, and a dedicated resume view with PDF generation capabilities.<br><br>The backend infrastructure is implemented as a serverless API using Azure Functions with C# and .NET 8. It provides a RESTful endpoint for the contact form, processing submissions and sending email notifications through SendGrid. This serverless architecture ensures cost-effectiveness, automatic scaling, and minimal maintenance overhead while maintaining high reliability and performance.<br><br>Both components are hosted on Azure cloud platform - the front-end on Azure Static Web Apps and the API on Azure Functions. The entire deployment process is fully automated through GitHub Actions, implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline that includes automated testing, building, and deployment triggered by code commits. This ensures rapid iteration cycles and consistent, reliable deployments to production."

Styling is based on TailwindCSS 4, animations implemented with the Motion library, and UI components leverage shadcn/ui and Radix UI. Multilingual support in three languages (Polish, English, Silesian) is provided by i18next. The application offers responsive design, dynamic countdown to event date, smooth navigation between sections, and interactive animations.<br><br>Routing based on subdomains is handled on the client side - the application checks the hostname and automatically renders the appropriate content version. This solution allowed for handling two different 'business requirements' using a single project, one codebase, and one deployment. Hosting on Azure Static Web Apps ensures global availability and automatic SSL certificates."

This requires deep understanding not only of technical aspects but also business goals and team constraints. Many people with diverse skills and perspectives must work in harmony to reach a common objective – and overseeing this process, identifying risks before they materialize, and supporting efficient team execution is as compelling to me as the code itself."
